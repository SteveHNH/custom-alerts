# Custom Alert Control Panel

A really simple control panel for sending alerts to the TwitchAlerts API.

I wanted something I could use for sending special graphcis and sounds to TwitchAlerts for specific events. This is pretty basic and can easily be customized for sending your own alerts. 

##### Special Note
Getting the Access Token for the API is out of scope for this project. TwitchAlerts provides an OAuth implementation for getting the token and authorizing your application. Check out the [API Docs](https://twitchalerts.readme.io) for more info.

### Installation
Clone the repo and run the python script. It's written for linux, so change the path at the top to reflect where your python install is, or update it to use windows instead.
